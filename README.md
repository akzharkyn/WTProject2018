## Electronic Menu
***
#### In our point of view, this project will interested by many restaurants, cafes and 
#### places like these. It will be electronic menu which will used instead of paper menus.
*** 
#### The main idea of electronic menu is there is no waitress who will accept the order. 
#### There will a list of snacks, dishes, culinary products, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages 
#### and other products that are on sale. Each category of foods will in different pages. Each 
#### item(food, drink) will clickable and will contain photo, description, price, weight. When 
#### client will click it, it will move to the order sheet of client. At the end of order sheet will total 
#### bill(total money) of order, people can see bill before accepting order. In our mind it is 
#### important and convenient. At the end, client will click "To order" button, after order sheet 
#### will sent to the chefs in kitchen or manager. Chefs will cook food looking electronic order 
#### sheet on the TV or computer which will located in the kitchen. Waitress will only bring food 
#### or drink to the client in the hall. 
***
#### 	If we come up with new ideas, we will add some functionalities.
